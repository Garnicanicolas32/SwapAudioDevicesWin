# SwapAudioDevicesWin
The "SwapAudioTrack" project is a lightweight Windows application that allows users to easily switch between audio playback devices. It provides a convenient system tray icon with a context menu that lists the available playback devices. Users can simply click on a device to switch the default audio playback device. The application is built using C# and utilizes the AudioSwitcher library for managing audio devices.
